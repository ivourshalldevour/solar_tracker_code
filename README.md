This repo holds all the code used during my honours year Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronic) thesis project at the University of Sydney. The final project succeeded in controlling two solar trackers, and comparing their power outputs against a fixed solar panel. The system was powered by a battery, and also performed data logging of all the power, voltage and current values for all three solar panels. One of the trackers was traditional in the sense that it calculated the position of the sun based on location, time and date, and moved the solar panel to face the Sun directly. The other solar tracker actually compared this direct sun-facing position against the rest of the sky. This tracker attempted to find any locations in the sky that might provide more solar power than facing directly at the sun on a cloudy day. The system was visited only once per week, which is when the battery and SDcard(with data) were swapped with new ones. The datalogs from each week are stored in the repo aswell.


All code was written to operate on two sepparate Arduino Uno R3 (with CH340 usb to serial converters (the cheapest kind of chinese knock off arduino)). 

The two 'top_level_...' files were the final executables that were uploaded to each arduino. All the other folders contain the sub modules the were included by the top level executables. Each sub-module had it's own testing script so that it's correct operation could be verified before integrating all the modules together.
